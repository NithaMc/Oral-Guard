## Project Description

Oral Guard is a web-based early oral screening platform that allows users to upload a tongue photo and receive an instant preliminary screening result. After answering a few health-related questions, the system provides guidance on whether medical consultation is recommended. The platform focuses on awareness and early risk indication and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

### The Problem
Many cases of oral cancer are diagnosed at a late stage due to lack of awareness and delayed medical consultation. People often ignore early symptoms or hesitate to visit healthcare professionals.

### The Solution
Oral Guard provides a simple, QR-based web platform where users can upload a tongue image, receive an instant screening indication, answer basic health questions, and get guidance on whether immediate medical consultation is recommended.
