### Project Description
A web-based early oral screening platform where users upload a tongue photo to receive an instant preliminary screening result. After answering a few health questions, the system provides guidance on whether medical consultation is recommended. The platform focuses on awareness and early risk indication, not medical diagnosis.

### The Problem statement
Many cases of oral cancer are diagnosed late due to lack of awareness and delayed medical consultation. People need a quick and accessible way to check early signs and understand when to seek professional care.

### The Solution
A web-based platform where users upload tongue photo to receive an instant preliminary screening result. After answering a few health questions, the system provides guidance on whether medical consultation is needed.
